## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
library(caret)
library(readr)

# Assuming that the CSV files are in your working directory
# Load the data
data <- read_csv("processed_data.csv")
labels <- read_csv("train_scores.csv")

# Merge the datasets on 'id' and prepare the data
data_merged <- merge(data, labels, by = 'id')
set.seed(123) # Setting a seed for reproducibility

# Split the data into features and labels
features <- data_merged[, !(names(data_merged) %in% c('id', 'score'))]
labels <- data_merged$score

# Create training (80%) and testing (20%) datasets
index <- createDataPartition(labels, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
train_data <- data_merged[index, ]
test_data <- data_merged[-index, ]

# Pre-process the data: center and scale the predictors
preProc <- preProcess(train_data[, !(names(train_data) %in% 'score')], method=c("center", "scale"))

train_data_processed <- predict(preProc, train_data)
test_data_processed <- predict(preProc, test_data)

# Define the control using a 10-fold cross-validation
trControl <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10)

# Tune the k parameter. This can take some time to run.
grid <- expand.grid(k = seq(1, 20, by = 1)) # Trying k from 1 to 20

# Train the model
set.seed(123)
knn_fit <- train(score ~ ., data = train_data_processed, method = "knn",
                 tuneGrid = grid, trControl = trControl)

# Summarize the results
print(knn_fit)

# Predict on test data
predictions <- predict(knn_fit, newdata = test_data_processed)

# Evaluate the model
postResample(pred = predictions, obs = test_data_processed$score)

# Plotting model performance
plot(knn_fit)
```
